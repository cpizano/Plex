Plex
====
Plex is Visual Studio 2013, C++11 project. In nutshell, a single
file (plex.cpp) does some primitive c++ parsing. It is kind of a
experiment in coding rather than a real program.

What kind of experiments?
- Zero copy string processing
- C+11/C+14 at large. What patterns are useful, avoid all macros, etc.

There are some not so useless pieces of code there, in particular
the file IO classes I am fond of even though they are incomplete.
